## Task Process üõ†Ô∏è

The task involved creating an intuitive form that collects essential information from interns including their joining date, personal details, department, internship period, and more. The form dynamically calculates the age of the intern based on their date of birth and provides additional flexibility for specifying the department.

- **CSS3:** Styling and layout are handled with CSS3, ensuring a visually appealing and responsive design.
- **JavaScript:** Dynamic functionalities such as age calculation, department selection, and last date computation are implemented using JavaScript.
